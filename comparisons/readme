===================
The html files in this directory are the result of using the summary.py script from OpenCV.

The base build with which 3 others were compared was a simple 'Release' configuration.
The other 3 configurations compared against it were:
1) Release + Floating Point
2) Release + TBB
3) Release + Floating Point + TBB
